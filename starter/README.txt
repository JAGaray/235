************************************************************************/

I used the makefile provided with the project. One of my current shortcomings is not understanding how to put a makefile together, this is something I will have to rectify quickly. 

I completed all parts of the assignments. I ran it through the assertion multiple times and came upon no errors, at least after dealing with all the errors.

My biggest challenge was memory leakage. I spent hours trying to figure out where my program was failing the assertion, only to find I had forgotten to delete a pointer along the way that was causing it to fail.

The project works by following the .h files given, and working through the assertions one by one. I went line-by-line and attempted to get past an assertion through my code. Then I would fix that piece and move on to the next assertion.
